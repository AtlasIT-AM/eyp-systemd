## Overview

systemd service support

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What systemd affects

It creates files on **/etc/systemd/system/${servicename}.service**

### Setup Requirements

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

### Beginning with systemd

basic example from eyp-kibana:

```puppet
systemd::service { 'kibana':
  execstart => "${basedir}/${productname}/bin/kibana",
  require   => [ Class['systemd'], File["${basedir}/${productname}/config/kibana.yml"] ],
  before => Service['kibana'],
}
```

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing
the fancy stuff with your module here.

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

Should work anywhere, tested on CentOS 7

## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some test to check both presence and absence of any feature
